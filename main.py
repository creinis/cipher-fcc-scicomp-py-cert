# Step 01
# Create a variable called number and assign it the value 5

number = 5

# Step 2
# Delete your number variable and its value. 
# Then, declare another variable called text and assign the string Hello World to this variable.

text = 'Hello World'

# Step 3
# Print your text variable to the screen by including the variable name between the opening and closing parentheses of the print() function.

print(text)

# Step 4
# Now, instead of printing text, print just the character at index 6

print(text[6])

# Step 5
# You can also access string characters starting from the end of the string. The last character has an index of -1, the second to last -2 and so on. 
# Now modify your existing print() call to print the last character in your string.

print(text[-1])

# Step 6
# Modify your existing print() call to print len(text).

print(len(text))
